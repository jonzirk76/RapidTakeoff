# Review Notes

## Spec compliance
- [ ] Invariants enforced everywhere (constructor + factories)
- [ ] Architectural formatting: 1/16 rounding + carry + fraction reduction
- [ ] Engineering formatting: carry inches overflow
- [ ] Decimal/scientific formatting ok
- [ ] Parsing covers required patterns and rejects negatives
- [ ] All rounding AwayFromZero

## Tests
- [ ] Invariant tests
- [ ] Conversion tests
- [ ] Formatting tests (arch + eng)
- [ ] Parsing tests
- [ ] Invalid input tests

## Follow-ups (new tickets)
- [ ] Boundary normalization (Project/ProjectPenetration)
- [ ] Replace raw doubles in input models
